# Session Status: coin_bgc Project

## Current State
- Project simulates biogeochemical carbon cycling for a given region/model using a simple annual time-stepping model.
- Reads historical data from CSV, filters for region/model, and runs a simulation using user-supplied or first-guess parameters.
- Ksoil, Kresp, and Ktfp are now linear functions of temperature (tas) and precipitation (pr) for each year.
- Initial parameters are generated by the `first_guess_user_params` function, which averages over the first N years of data.
- Results are saved to a CSV file in `data/output/`.

## Next Steps
- Implement parameter optimization routines to fit Ksoil, Kresp, and Ktfp parameters (and their tas/pr dependencies) to minimize the difference between predicted and observed GPP and NPP.
- Consider adding plotting and diagnostics for model/data comparison.
- Expand to batch runs for multiple regions/models.
- Add more advanced model features as needed.
